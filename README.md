# learn.code

learn.code is the place to be to learn how to program!

## Setup

### IDE
In this learn.code session, Java will be the language of choice for showcasing the basics of coding.

Here are the following links to get started with your IDE for Java:
- Jetbrains - IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/
- Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Another option would be to use a editor such as:
- Sublime Text
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
 - Visual Studio Code can act as an IDE by installing many types of plugins! It's a very nice tool for coding

### Code Repo Management

We will be using git to manage our code, but it might be overwhelming for new users as there are a lot of commands to learn. As such, I would suggest to download SourceTree, https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/, which is a Git GUI. All you would need to do is hook it up to your repository.

### Mac setup

#### Installing Homebrew

We will be using homebrew a lot so please install homebrew via the terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

#### Installing Git

Open the terminal and use the following command:

```
brew install git
```

Check if git is install properly:

```
git --version
```
